# Introduction

MyTeam by BNI is an app built to simplify robotics team operations. This documentation explains how to use the MyTeam by BNI app.&#x20;

The current core features are:

* Scouting other team's robots before matches
* Collecting match data and team performance during matches
* Sharing scouting responses with other teams for collaboration
* Scheduling team members to different tasks during different matches.

We plan to continue developing the app to include more features, and will update this documentation every Sunday (if necessary) to keep it in sync.

The application can be accessed on any device using this [link](https://onelink.to/ym2w3h). Clicking it on a mobile device will automatically take you to your app store to download the app. Clicking it on a non-mobile app will open the web application. The web application can also be accessed on mobile devices. The web application can be found [here](https://app.myteamapp.org).

Please keep in mind that while all of the documentation uses mobile images, the web application's functionality is the same. Exceptions between mobile and web app functionality will be noted throughout the documentation, and a comprehensive list of these exceptions can be found below:
