# Join a Team

There are two ways to join a team. The first is by registering as a new user. After 10 seconds, you will be redirected to the Join Team page.

The second way is to tap the 'Join/Create Team' button in the menu as an online logged-in user.

If you only enter your team ID, a request will be sent to your coach to let you into the team.

If you enter an ID as well as an Authorization ID provided by your coach, you will immediately join your team and will be able to access all functionality.

If you would like to register a new team on the app, tap the 'Create Team Account' button to go to the [Create a Team Account](create-a-team-account.md) page.
