# Login

On the login page, you can enter your user ID to login, as well as proceed to [Register a User](register-a-user.md).

After clicking the 'Login' button, you will be taken to a page for a few seconds that generates a cache of your data. See [Caching](../technical/caching.md) for more information.

Note that if you're a member of multiple teams, you'll first be taken to a page to select which team you'd like to login with before being taken to the Cache page.

If the id that you entered was invalid, you'll get a notification warning you about it.

If you're still getting this error, ask your coach to tell you your ID. They can see it by going into Settings -> Users and clicking the edit icon. Your ID will be next to your name.
