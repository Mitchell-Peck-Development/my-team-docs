# Notifications

The app has a few built in notifications for different events.

When your [notification preferences](../settings/app-settings.md#notification-preferences) are both on and your cache is on, you will receive two notifications every time you open the app.

These notifications are to let you know that you're online and that your data is being cached.

When you receive a direct message, if you aren't in the message's chat, you will receive a notification.

When you receive a message from a group chat, if you aren't in the group's chat, you will receive a notification.

When you receive an announcement, you will receive a notification.

The Direct Message, Group, and Announcement notifications are also sent to your device's notifications area. Direct Message and Group notifications are regular notifications, and Announcement notifications are Time Sensitive notifications on iOS.
