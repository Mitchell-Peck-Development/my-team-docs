# Feedback

If you have any feedback for the team, there's a few ways to submit it depending on the type of feedback.

If you have an issue with the app, whether it be a bug, error, or another problem, you can report it in the app by going to the Help page, which can be accessed from the top right of the Settings page, and tapping 'Submit Issue or Request', or by tapping [here](myteam://route#to=help) if you have the app installed.

If you have a suggestion for the app, you can check out our roadmap and submit new feature ideas by going to the Help page, which can be accessed from the top right of the settings page, and tapping 'Open Roadmap'. This can also be accessed from the [MyTeam by BNI Website](https://myteamapp.org).

To submit and vote on features, you will be required to create an account on the roadmap. You can use either a Google account or a code sent to your email.
