# Forms

As a manager, the Forms page will look slightly different.

By tapping on the pencil button on a form, you can edit the form template. Editing a form template will remove it from view for all users until you publish it again.

By tapping on the red archive button on a form template, you can archive the form template. Archiving a form template will save its responses, which will still be visible from the responses page, but no new submissions will be able to be created. Form templates can be unarchived by using the archive button in the top left.

To create a new form template, tap the plus button in the top right. This will open the form template builder. Editing a form also opens the form template builder.
