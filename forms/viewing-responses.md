Tapping the 'Share' button next to a template will allow you to share its responses with other teams in the teams registry.

To configure the teams that a template's responses are shared with, tap the 'View' button next to a template in the main sharing dialog.

To share the template's responses with another team, enter the team's numbeer and tap the 'Add' button. If the team is in the teams registry, they will be able to see all responses for this form template. If they aren't in the teams registry they won't be added to the sharing.

To stop sharing responses with another team, tap the red 'x' button next to the team's number.
