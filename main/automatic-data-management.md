# Automatic Data Management

Automatic data management is a feature that allows you to tell the app whether or not to automatically upload your responses for coaches and team members to see on the [Management Portal](https://app.gitbook.com/s/OOET5QiwzcXSGYSA6P9o/), as well as whether or not to be checking if other users have already submitted pregame information for the team that you've selected.

When Automatic Data Management is turned on, each time you complete a form the app will automatically uplaod your responses. In addition, it will check if one of your team members have already completed a pregame form for your selected team. If this is the case, the Pregame Poll button will be disabled.

When Automatic Data Management is turned off, you will need to click Upload Responses to manually upload your responses. In addition, if a team member has already completed a pregame form for your selected team, you will still be able to complete another pregame form for that team.

Note: When you are connected to WiFi and are able to use an internet connection, it is recommended to keep Automatic Data Managment on. However, make sure to turn it off once matches have started, as you will be prohibited from connecting to an internet connection and will need to upload your responses at the end of the match.
