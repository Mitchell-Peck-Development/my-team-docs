# Uploading your Responses

When you click Upload Responses, your data will be uploaded for coaches and team members to see on the [Management Portal](https://app.gitbook.com/s/OOET5QiwzcXSGYSA6P9o/). However, this is only necessary when [Automatic Data Management](automatic-data-management.md) is turned off.

After clicking Upload Responses, you should get a notification. If there is an error, it will let you know. Otherwise, you will get a confirmation message that your Pregame/Midgame responses have been uplaoded.
