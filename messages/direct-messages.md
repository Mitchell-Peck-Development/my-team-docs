# Direct Messages

Direct Messages allow you to communicate with your team members, as well as members from other teams if your team is in the Teams Registry.

If you have any unread direct messages, they will show up with a 'New' badge next to the chat. There will also be a count next to the messages icon showing how many unread messages you have.

Chats with members from another team will be marked with a red 'External' badge. You can start a new chat by tapping the overflow menu in the top right.&#x20;

Only members that you don't already have a chat with will appear in the list.
