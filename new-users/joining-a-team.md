# Joining a Team

There are two ways to join a team:

* Send a Request
* Use an Authorization Code

To start, from the home page, click 'Open Settings'.

This will take you directly to the Team Settings page.

If your team isn't on MyTeam yet, an adult must create your team. Adults can follow this guide here to create their team on MyTeam.
{% endhint %}

If you don't have an authorization code, you can enter your team's number and click 'Join'. This will send a request to your team's managers, who can accept your request into the team.

If you have an authorization code from a manager or adult, you can enter it in the Authorization Code field. This will immediately add you to your team.

After a few seconds, your team should now be listed under Current Team.

After clicking your team, you should see your team settings below the Current Team section.
