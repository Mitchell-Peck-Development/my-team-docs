# Event Editor

To create an event, tap the plus button on the [Events](events.md) page.

In the event editor, you can configure the name, information, RSVP, status, start & end date & time, repetition, invited members, and notifications.

### Event Status

The event status allows you to show the status of the event. Available options are Confirmed, Potential, and Cancelled.

When the status is set to 'Potential', you will also see an option for status threshold.

#### Event Status Threshold

The event status threshold allows you to set a threshold for when the event should automatically go from 'Potential' to 'Confirmed', and backwards. This is useful for if you only host practices when a certain number of members are attending.&#x20;

When the number of members 'Available' for the event is greater than the threshold, the event status will be updated to 'Confirmed'. When the number of members 'Going' for the event goes below the threshold, the event status will be changed back to 'Potential'.

{% hint style="info" %}
Adults to not affect the status threshold.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You will always be able to go in and manually change the status. If you override the event status from 'Potential' to 'Confirmed', the threshold will be reset and the event status will not revert if the 'Going' member count goes back down.
{% endhint %}

### Date & Time

#### Repetition

You can choose to repeat the event manually, daily, weekly, or monthly.

Repeating an event will link the repeated events together so edits to one can be applied to all. Read more [below](event-editor.md#saving-a-linked-event).

### Invited Members

Tapping on the pencil button next to invited members will allow you to configure the invited members. You can choose from the entire team, a group, or select members.

### Notifications

You can configure two types of notifications: alerts and reminders.

#### Alerts

Alerts are sent to every member who has responded as 'Going' to the event.

#### Reminders

Reminders are sent to every member who has not responded to the event.

### Saving a Linked Event

If you edit and save an event that is linked to another event, you will have two options: apply changes to all events, or only save this event and remove it from the link.

Note that even if you apply changes to all events, the date and time will not be changed for any of the events except for the original event that you edited.
