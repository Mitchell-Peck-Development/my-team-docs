# Practices & Events

Practices & Events allow you to register for events for your team. This can be anything like practices, events, or service opportunities.

You can create a group chat for an event by tapping the message button for an event that you've confirmed your attendance for.

You can see a count of the members going to the event next to the eye button.

You can respond to a regular event by tapping the 'Going' button, and if you change your mind, you can tap the red 'x' button to clear your response.

You can respond to an event requiring RSVP by tapping either the 'Going', 'Maybe', or 'Not Going' button. If you change your mind, you can update your response accordingly.

{% hint style="info" %}
If an event that requires RSVP is occurring within the next 24 hours, you will only see the 'Going' and 'Not Going' options.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If an event's status is 'Potential', then instead of seeing 'Going' and 'Not Going', you will see 'Available' and 'Not Available'.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If an event is cancelled, you won't be able to add or change your response.
{% endhint %}

You can view the users invited to an event, as well as users who responded as' Going' or 'Not Going' (for RSVP events), by tapping the eye button for the event.
