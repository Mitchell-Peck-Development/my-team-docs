# Schedule

The schedule page will show you what task you're on at an event. Coaches can use this feature to schedule team members during events so team members know where they're supposed to be, whether it's scouting a particular alliance at a particular team, taking breaks, or working in the pits.

The current task shows what task you're on. Tasks are typically scheduled based off of matches, with each match corresponding to a task. However, your coach can set it up however they like, and they will tell you how they're using it.&#x20;

All tasks are listed under All Tasks, and the current text is colored yellow.

By pressing the 'Next' button, you'll progress to the next task. Tasks loop, so once you get to the last task, pressing the 'Next' button will take you back to the top of the list. Make sure you keep track of what match is occurring (if that's what time block method your coach is using - if they aren't, they should tell your team what time system they're using).

When you first log in, and every time you rebuild the cache, one of the items that are saved is what task you're supposed to start on, which is specified by your coach. That will be the first item shown in current task.
