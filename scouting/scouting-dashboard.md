# Scouting Dashboard

The Scouting Dashboard will look slightly different depending on which [Data Transfer Method](../technical/data-transfer-methods.md) method you have selected, if any.

## Usage

From the Scouting Dashboard, you will see all the teams attending your next event. If there isn't an event for your team in the future, it will show all teams from the most recent event.

By clicking on a team from the list, you can see some basic information about that team, as well as proceed to the Scouting and Match Data Forms.

By clicking either the Scouting Form or the Match Data Form, you'll be taken to the respective form page. Both are similar in content; see more information about both at [Scouting Forms](scouting-forms.md).

By clicking the 'Upload Data' button, any scouting data on your device will be uploaded to our servers, and then deleted from your device.

By clicking the 'Generate Code to Scan' button, you'll be taken to the Data QR Codes page. More information about this page can be found in [Scan & Transfer](../technical/scan-and-transfer.md).
