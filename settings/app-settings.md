# App Settings

The settings page is divided into two sections: app settings and team settings.

The app settings page allows you to configure security, cache, event, notification, start page, and menu settings.

## Security

### Biometric Login

The Biometric Login setting allows you to choose whether you want to be required to use your device's biometric authentication to access the app, as well as perform select actions.

If your device doesn't support biometric authentication, the toggle will be disabled.

If your team requires its members to use biometric authentication, the toggle will be disabled in the on position, unless your device doesn't support biometric authentication.

## Cache Preferences

The cache is what allows the app to work offline.

### Cache Status

When the cache is on, data for Messages, Form Templates, and Task Suites will be automatically synced to your device every minute. You can turn the cache on and off using the cache toggle.

### Individual Selection

You can choose whether or not data from Messages, Form Templates, and Task Suites are cached using the individual selection toggles below the cache toggle.

When the cache is off, the individual selection toggles won't be visible.

## Event Options

### Event Mode

Event Mode allows you to manually turn the app's network connection off. This will have the app act as if it is offline, including force any cached data to be used and save form responses locally for offloading to an online device using QR codes. This is useful for if you are at an event and are going to be creating lots of form submissions, like when you're scouting. This will force all your submissions to stay offline, so you're able to make sure they're all uploaded when you're ready to offload them to another device. Read more in [Offline Submissions and Offloading](../forms/offline-submissions-and-offloading/).

## Notification Preferences

### Cache Notifications

Cache Notifications are sent to update you on the status of the cache. When Cache Notifications is on, you'll receive notifications when the cache is active, inactive, and when it's inactive because you're offline or in [Event Mode](app-settings.md#event-mode).

{% hint style="info" %}
Regardless of the Cache Notifications setting, you will still receive error messages if the cache encounters an error.
{% endhint %}

### Network Notifications

Network Notifications are sent to update you on the status of your network connection. When Network Notifications is on, you'll receive notifications when you're online, offline, and when your network status changes from either online to offline or offline to online.

## Start Page

Each time you open the app, it will launch to whichever start page you choose from the dropdown.

***

## Menu

You are able to customize menu slots 1-3, 5, and 6. Slots 1 and 7 are forced to Home and Overflow, respectively.
