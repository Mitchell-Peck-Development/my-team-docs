To log out of the app, tap 'Log Out' in the top left of the [Settings](broken-reference) page. Then tap the 'Log Out' button in the alert dialog.

If you need to reset the app because it isn't acting as expected, tap 'Log Out' in the top left of the [Settings](broken-reference) page. Then tap the 'Reset App' button in the alert dialog. You wil still be signed in, but all other app data will be reset and removed.
