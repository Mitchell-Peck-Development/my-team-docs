You are now able to manage team creatives, members, and managers.

### Team Creatives

Tapping the pencil button next to team creatives will open the team creatives dialog.

The primary and secondary team colors are used throughout the app in elements like the menu, messages, and most buttons.

Scrolling down shows you previews for the menu and for messages so that you can make sure your colors will work correctly with the app.
