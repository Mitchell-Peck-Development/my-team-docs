## Team Creatives

The Team Creatives section shows you your team's Primary Team Color and Secondary Team Color. You can also quickly copy either color.

## Team Members

The Team Members section shows you the list of your team's members on MyTeam. Adults are marked with a red 'Adult' badge, and Managers are marked with an orange 'Manager' badge. You will be at the top of the list marked with a 'You' badge that is the same color as your team's primary color.
