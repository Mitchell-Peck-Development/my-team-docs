# Tasks

As a manager, the Tasks page will look slightly different.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some suites may appear for you with the 'View Tasks' button disabled. This is because you created the suite, but aren't assigned any tasks.
{% endhint %}

By tapping on the pencil button on a suite, you can edit the suite. Editing a suite will remove it from view for all users until you publish it again. Similar to editing a Form Template, a dialog will appear confirming that you'd like to edit the suite.

By tapping on the red archive button on a suite, you can archive the suite. Archiving a suite will remove it from view for all users. Suites can be unarchived using the archive button in the top left.

To create a new suite, tap the plus button in the top right. This will open the suite creator. Editing a suite opens the suite editor.
