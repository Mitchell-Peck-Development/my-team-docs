The suite instructions will tell you how the suite is intended to be used. Tapping the 'Next Task' button will take you to the next task in the list, or bring you back to the top of the list if you're already at the end.

The initial task assigned to you will be marked with a blue 'Initial' badge. Your current task will be marked with a 'Current' badge that is the same color as your team's primary color.
