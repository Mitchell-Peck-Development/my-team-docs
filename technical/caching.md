# Caching

Every time you log in, as well as every 24 hours, you will be taken to a page that builds a cache of your data. During this process, the app requests all relevant team, match, scouting, and user information from our servers, and saves it to your device. This way, operation-critical actions such as scouting and team information are always accessible, even when you're offline. This feature is handy for competitions, where an internet connection is never guaranteed, and often unreliable.&#x20;

Note, however, that even though a cache has been built, not all data for non-operation-critical actions is saved. You will still need an active internet connection to take actions such as team management, questions sharing, and questions management.&#x20;

Also note that even though a cache has been built, if you have an active internet connection, the app will often request more recent data from our servers, if possible.

## Rebuilding Cache

When you open your menu, if you are online and the 'Automatic - WiFi' Data Transfer Method is switched on, you will see an option to 'Rebuild Cache'. This is useful if you know that data has been changed since your last cache, you're on an active internet connection, and you want to make it available while offline. Clicking this button will take you to the caching page for a few seconds, before returning you to the Dashboard page.
