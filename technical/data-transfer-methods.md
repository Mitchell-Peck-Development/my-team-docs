# Data Transfer Methods

Data Transfer Methods are part of what makes the MyTeam by BNI app so unique. By allowing the user to specify how they want their data to be handled, we are able to provide a versatile platform that works great with both an active internet connection as well as no internet connection.

By default, every time you login, both Data Transfer Methods will be turned off. However, your Data Transfer Method preference is saved to your device, so you don't have to reconfigure them every time you open the app.

## What's the point?

Data Transfer Methods primarily determine what you're able to do with scouting as well as settings if you're a manager.

Note that you'll only be able to have one Data Transfer Method switched on at a time. If you attempt to turn on a second Data Transfer Method, the first one will be switched off.

## Automatic - Wifi

When the 'Automatic - WiFi' Data Transfer Method is on, your scouting responses will be automatically uploaded, and you'll be able to analyze responses. You'll also be able to configure settings if you're a manager.

## Scan & Transfer

When the 'Scan & Transfer' Data Transfer Method is on, you'll be able to generate QR codes for each of your responses to be scanned by a computer on the Scan page. Learn more about [Scan & Transfer](scan-and-transfer.md) here.

## Neither

When neither Data Transfer Method is selected, you'll need to manually upload your responses using the 'Upload Data' button.
